## Prime Patterns
![Alt text for the image]([prime.png](https://github.com/Tonumoy/Primes_on_Poles/blob/main/Prime_patterns.png))
This Jupyter notebook visualizes the distribution of prime numbers on a polar plot using an animated format. The notebook demonstrates an engaging method to visualize prime numbers as they are identified and plotted sequentially.

### Features
- **Prime Number Generation**: Dynamically generate a specified number of prime numbers.
- **Visual Representation**: Use a polar plot to represent each prime number as a point on the plot.
- **Animation**: Animate the plotting of each prime number with different colors and optional text labels for clarity.

### Configuration
You can customize various parameters including:
- `num_primes`: Total number of primes to plot.
- `slow_count`: Number of primes to animate slowly for emphasis.
- `slow_interval` & `fast_interval`: Control the animation speed.
- `marker_size` & `font_size`: Adjust the visual size of plot markers and text.
- `blink_color` & `normal_color`: Customize the colors used during animation.

### Running the Notebook
Ensure you have Python installed with the following dependencies:
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

Run the notebook to observe the generation and plotting of prime numbers. The final output includes a saved animation in MP4 format.

### Contributions
Feel free to fork or contribute to this project by enhancing the visualization techniques or extending the prime number generator for larger datasets.
